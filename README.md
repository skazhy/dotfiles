# Dotfiles

This is a work in progress, I am syncing all my boxes with this, so many things will be added in the (near) future. If you have one or more of listed files below (or have some precious modifications), **please backup them**, if you intend to use the automated install script.

## Contents

*  `bashrc`
*  `gemrc`
*  `gitconfig`
*  Openbox dotfiles
*  URxvt dotfiles (currently - `Xresources` only)
*  Vim dotfiles (`vimrc`, plugins and color schemes - as submodules or download links)
*  `Xmodmap`
*  `zshrc`
