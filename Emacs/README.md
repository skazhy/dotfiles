# Emacs profiles

See [SETUP.md](../doc/SETUP.md) for setup instructions.

There are two configurations here. I switch between them with
`--init-directory` flag that was introduced in Emacs 29.

* `doom.d` - [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) configuration that's used daily
* `plain` - a work in progress configuration, that might replace Doom Emacs one fine day
